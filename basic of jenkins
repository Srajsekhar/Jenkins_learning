in this we will learn about the baic of jenkins stage:
-----------------------------------
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            options {
                timeout(time: 3, unit: 'MINUTES')
            }
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
                // Your build commands here
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing...'
                // Your test commands here
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying...'
                // Your deploy commands here
            }
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------
Explanation
pipeline: Defines the entire Jenkins pipeline.
agent any: Specifies that the pipeline can run on any available agent.
stages: Contains the different stages of the pipeline.
stage('Build'): Defines the Build stage.
options: Contains options specific to the stage.
timeout(time: 3, unit: 'MINUTES'): Sets a timeout of 3 minutes for the stage.
steps: Contains the steps to be executed within the stage.
echo 'Building...': Prints a message to the console (replace this with your actual build commands).
stage('Test') and stage('Deploy'): Define additional stages for testing and deployment (replace with actual commands as needed).
By using the timeout directive, you can ensure that your Jenkins stages do not run indefinitely and adhere to the specified time limits.
